# Final project proposal


## Hardware/software proposal 1 
Use an led array to show the position of a potentiometer. Software will control a register that defines the sensitivity(How many steps in a turn).

## Hardware/software proposal 2
We will use a pair of push buttons to shift an led pattern around an array of leds, software will control the pattern that the leds hold to be shifted via one register on the hps lightweight bus.

## Extra credit
Something with the IMU

## Division of labor
Zach will be designing the VHDL for the led array changing with the potentiometer and coding the supporting software for the led array controlled by push buttons and a register that holds the pattern.
Ian will be designing the VHDL for the led array that changes with the push buttons and coding the supporting software for the led array that changes with the potentiometer.
