# 467-final-project
## Overview
This project uses hardware and software in tandem to implement various functionalities described below:  
1. RGB LED controlled by PWM based on the position of 3 potentiometers 
	* RGB ELD
	* ADC
	* Potentiometers
2. LED array with pattern that shifts dependent on push buttons
	* 8 external LEDs
	* One register to hold the base pattern
	* 2 push buttons to determine shift right or shift left.
3. LED array that displays relative position of potentiometer  
	* 8 on board LEDs
	* Two registers  
		1. Sending the potentiometer position
		2. Chooses what pattern is displayed
	* One potentiometer.
